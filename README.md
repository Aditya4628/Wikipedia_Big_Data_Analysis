**BIG DATA WIKIPEDIA ANALYSIS**

The Big Data Analysis of Wikipedia Pages project aims to explore and analyze the vast amount of data generated by Wikipedia's millions of users and pages. Wikipedia, as a rich source of global knowledge, presents unique opportunities for big data analysis, offering insights into user behaviors, content popularity, emerging trends, and more. This project leverages advanced data processing technologies to uncover patterns, predict trends, and enhance the understanding of digital content interaction on a massive scale.

**DATASETS USED**

1. Clickstream Data Dump: Navigation paths of users within Wikipedia, including source and destination pages, click counts, and timestamps.
   
2. Pages Data Dump (English and Simple English): Text of Wikipedia articles in English and Simple English, covering a broad range of topics for text analysis and natural language processing.
   
3. Revision History Data Dump: Complete revision history of Wikipedia articles, detailing every edit made, including the editor, timestamp, and content changes.

**TECHNOLOGY USED**

1. Apache Spark: Open-source big data processing engine for large-scale data analysis, including machine learning, graph processing, and data visualization.
   
2. Dask: Parallel computing library for Python, used for processing large datasets that cannot fit into memory on a single machine, suitable for tasks like filtering, grouping, and data aggregation.

**Basic Analysis with Visualizations**

1. Visit Frequency and Popular Pages/Categories: Analysis of the most visited pages and categories, using clickstream and pages data to identify user preferences.
   
2. Exit Point Determination: Identifying common exit points from Wikipedia, which could indicate user engagement levels with certain content.

3. Top Word Identifier and Links Analysis: Utilizing text data for identifying frequently used words and analyzing internal link structures to uncover content relationships.

4. Revision and Contribution Analysis: Examining the revision history to highlight the most active contributors and heavily edited pages, reflecting community engagement.
